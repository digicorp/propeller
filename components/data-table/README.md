Propellerâ€™s data tables refers to a matrix of information, like an excel spreadsheet with columns, rows, and data. It is used to present raw data sets, and usually appears in desktop enterprise products. We have used <a href="https://datatables.net/examples/styling/bootstrap.html" target="_blank">Bootstrap Data table</a> as base and customized it by applying material design principles to it. 

<a href="http://propeller.in/" target="_blank">Propeller</a> is a front-end responsive framework based on Google's Material Design Standards & Bootstrap. It is an open source library created at <a href="https://www.digi-corp.com/" target="_blank">Digicorp.</a></p>
