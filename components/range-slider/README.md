Propeller’s range slider lets the user select a range of values by moving the slider thumb. The smallest value is to the left, the largest to the right. We have used <a href="https://refreshless.com/nouislider/" target="_blank">noUISlider</a> plugin as a base and customized it by applying material design principles to it. 

<a href="http://propeller.in/" target="_blank">Propeller</a> is a front-end responsive framework based on Google's Material Design Standards & Bootstrap. It is an open source library created at <a href="https://www.digi-corp.com/" target="_blank">Digicorp.</a>
