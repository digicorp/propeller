Propeller’s datetimepicker component allows user to select a date from a calendar and time from a visual analog clock; it also accepts values via direct input. You can find a wide variety of date and time pickers here. We have used <a href="http://eonasdan.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/" target="_blank">Bootstraps’ datetimepicker</a> and applied material design principles to it.

<a href="http://propeller.in/" target="_blank">Propeller</a> is a front-end responsive framework based on Google's Material Design Standards & Bootstrap. It is an open source library created at <a href="https://www.digi-corp.com/" target="_blank">Digicorp.</a></p>
